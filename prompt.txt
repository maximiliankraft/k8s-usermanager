if you look at the script add-user.sh you can see that it adds a user to a k8s cluster. i would need some extra functionality. the newly created users should have the ability to host services on their own subdomain. so lets say i (the admin) own the variable example.com a new user with the name user1 shall have access to the domain user1.example.com . assume i have a wildcard certificate, that is all set up. please create a new file and call it add-user-with-ingress or something like that
